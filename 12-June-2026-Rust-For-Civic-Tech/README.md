# Rust For Civic Tech

Presented by Collins Muriuki ([`@c12i`](https://c12i.xyz))

**Date**: 12th June 2026

## About the Talk

A tour through three open-source Rust projects that grew into one civic data
platform for Kenya's parliamentary data:

- **Bunge Bits**: transcribes parliamentary livestreams from YouTube using
  Whisper and LLM summarization
- **odnelazm**: a unified scraper, CLI, and MCP server for Kenya's official
  Hansard records, covering both the current site and the archive back to 2006
- **Bunge Hub**: the web frontend that puts all of this in front of citizens

The talk covers scraping messy real-world HTML, structuring it into a
Postgres-backed ingest pipeline, exposing it over a CLI and an MCP server, and
enriching it with local LLMs, all in production Rust.
